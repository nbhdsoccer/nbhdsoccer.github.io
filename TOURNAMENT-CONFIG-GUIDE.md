- **Memorial:** Honoring David's legacy through participation
- **Community:** No jerseys or lunches - focus on ceremony and documentation
- **Recognition:** Balanced benefits across all registration types
- **Accessibility:** Clear pricing tiers for different participation levels

This structure creates a respectful, memorial-focused experience while providing clear value for all participants and sponsors.
