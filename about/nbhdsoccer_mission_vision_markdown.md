## WHO WE ARE

Chicago Neighborhood Soccer (CNS) is a grassroots nonprofit organization founded by experienced community leaders who have been organizing pickup games and leagues across Chicago's South and West Side neighborhoods for over a decade. While officially established as an Illinois nonprofit in 2022, our leadership team brings 10+ years of soccer community-building experience to this venture.

What began as passionate individuals creating informal weekly games has evolved into a vibrant community of over 6,500 members, all through word-of-mouth and the reputation we've built for quality experiences.
