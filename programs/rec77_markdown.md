## Sports Programming Built With You, Not For You

*A Chicago Neighborhood Soccer Initiative*

---

## WHO WE ARE

We're Chicago Neighborhood Soccer - a nonprofit run by locals who've been organizing games in South and West Side neighborhoods for 10+ years. We grew up here, still live here, and have built a 6,500+ member community through trust and consistency.

**REC 77** represents our commitment to all 77 neighborhoods in Chicago - starting with the ones we call home.

> **Simple truth:** We're not outsiders parachuting in - we're neighbors who know how to make sports work in our communities.

## THE REC 77 APPROACH

Instead of selling you a pre-packaged program, we **co-develop** something that actually fits your school:

### Your Input:
- What sports work in your space?
- What does your schedule look like?
- What do your kids actually want to play?
- What's your real budget situation?

### Our Experience:
- 10+ years organizing successful sports programs
- Equipment, coaching, and referee management
- Fair team balancing (no blowouts, everyone competes)
- Event management that actually shows up

> **Together:** We build something that works for your students and your reality.

## WHAT PRINCIPALS TELL US THEY NEED

âœ… Programs that actually engage kids (not just check boxes)  
âœ… Vendors who understand budget constraints  
âœ… People who show up and do what they say  
âœ… Activities that build school community  
âœ… Partners, not just service providers  

---

## WHY US? THE HONEST VERSION

âœ… **We're Local** - These are the neighborhoods we grew up in  
âœ… **We're Proven** - 6,500+ people play with us because we deliver  
âœ… **We're Flexible** - Every school is different; we adapt  
âœ… **We're Realistic** - We know budgets are tight  
âœ… **We're Reliable** - 10+ years of showing up consistently  

> **The Reality:** We're new to CPS as an official vendor, but we're not new to organizing sports or working with kids in these communities.
